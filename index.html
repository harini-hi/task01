            <p>Just as there are many human languages, computer programmers use different web development languages to communicate with machines. Aspiring web developers can choose from many options when selecting the best programming language to create websites and apps. <br><br>In the 1960s, there were fewer than 10 computer programming languages. Today, thousands of these languages exist. Historically, the most popular languages have been Python, C, and Java, but SQL, Swift, and other contemporary languages are growing fast. This guide explores several popular programming languages and helps readers narrow down the right choices.</p>

            <h1 style="color: brown;">Programming Languages vs. Coding Languages</h1>
            <p>Professionals use computer programming languages to give computers instructions that they can understand. A programming language is a human-readable programming code. There are many different types of programming languages, the most popular being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>Coding is a subset of programming. Coders write instructions for machines in programming languages. The two terms — programming languages and coding languages — are functionally interchangeable, however.<br><br>Programming languages appear as domain-specific languages (DSL) and general-purpose languages. DSLs work within given programming environments, while general-purpose programming languages can be compiled or interpreted without any knowledge of the system architecture or platform.<br><br>example, while C++ will not run on Python or PHP, these languages work on Java (and most other systems) because they are all general-purpose programming languages.</p>

            <h1 style="color: brown;">How Programming Languages Are Used in Web Development</h1>
            <p>Developers use web development languages to help create dynamic web pages. The most common languages include JavaScript, Python, and C#. Developers choose the language to use based on whether they perform front-end or back-end development. In artificial intelligence creation, machine learning engineers also use programming languages to develop applications</p>

            <h1 style="color: brown;">Choosing a Web Development Programming Language</h1>
            <p>The right coding language depends on your career goals and interests, but the following are all good choices: C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby on Rails, and PHP. You might even consider learning two languages — one for front-end development and the other for back-end work.<br><br>Python and Ruby work well for back-end development, while JavaScript suits the front end. All three languages are relatively easy to learn.<br><br>While hobbyists can dive into books and online courses, aspiring professionals may need a more structured and disciplined approach to language learning. Coding bootcamps offer intensive courses in different programming languages that can help get you started with minimal cost and effort</p>
